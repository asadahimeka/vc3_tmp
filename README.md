**You diverged from the boilerplate on Aug 14 2018. See [what's been added](https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate/compare/f09421803824a3f28d6912a1cefb849c32413811...master) since then.**

> This is an ever-evolving, very opinionated architecture and dev environment for new Vue SPA projects using [Vue CLI 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). Questions, feedback, and for now, even bikeshedding are welcome. If you'd like to increase the time I can spend on this project, as well as other Vue resources, **please consider becoming a [sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/chrisvuefritz)**.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate.git my-new-project

# 2. Enter your newly-cloned folder
cd my-new-project

# 3. Replace this README's CI badge with a note about when you started
# and a link to a compare URL, so that you can always get an overview
# of new features added to the boilerplate since you cloned.
node _start.js

# 4. Delete the start script, as there can be only one beginning.
rm _start.js

# 5. Read the documentation "Setup and development".
